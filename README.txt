Mouser is a simple mouse position storing & restoring program for Windows.

I wrote it because I found using a mouse with several large monitors
frustrating.

While running, simply press 'alt' and one of the number keys.  That will store
the current position of your mouse.  Then when you press 'control' and that
number key, it will move the position of your mouse back there.  These
positions are not persisted anywhere, so if Mouser is stopped you have to
re-store your positions.

Note that Mouser uses system-wide hotkeys to achieve this, so if you use these
combinations of keypresses in any program Mouser will block them.
